title: Classing in ES2015
---

In a previous (post)[http://www.mikedoescoding.com/Classing-in-ES5/], I explained how classes can be made using ES5 syntax. In ES5, constructor functions are used to create class-like objects. When creating a subclass, it is necessary to set up the inheritance chain and set the correct `constructor` property. In ES2015, the `class` keyword is used to create classes and the `extends` keyword is used to create subclasses. Using the same examples of a `Car` and `Van` from the previous post, the classes will be refactored to use ES2015 `class` and `extends` syntax.
