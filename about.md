I currently work at [ClickFox](https://www.clickfox.com/) as a software engineer building UIs within the Angular ecosystem. Formerly, I was a scientist and educator. I enjoy discovering new features, libraries, hacks and more in web development and blogging about them. I want to share what I learn.
