I currently work at [Quizlet](https://www.quizlet.com/) as a software engineer building UIs with React and Typescript with a Hacklang backend. I'm a co-organizer for the [DenverScript](https://www.meetup.com/DenverScript/) meetup group. Formerly, I was a scientist and educator. I enjoy discovering new features, libraries, hacks and more in web development and blogging about them. I want to share what I learn.
